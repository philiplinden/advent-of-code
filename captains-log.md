Trying out advent of code for the first time. I'm trying out some tooling
from
[ChristopherBiscardi/advent-of-code](https://github.com/ChristopherBiscardi/advent-of-code),
including [just](https://github.com/casey/just) for the first time.

I use `nushell` as my shell, so I had to modify the `justfile` to work with it.
I ended up making a few more changes to get it working the way I wanted. I added
setup instructions to the README.

This setup is a pain in the ass, but it's a good excercise in tooling. I'm going
through and recreating all the tooling in shell and python that I understand.
I could probably reuse some of this as a template for game jams and the like.

I experimented with nushell for a bit, but I think I'll spend some time making a
proper CLI tool in rust or python. I'll start with rust for practice.

I made the rust CLI and like it a lot so far.
